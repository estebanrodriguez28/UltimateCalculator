#!/bin/bash
# The first two characters in the above line is called the shebang (#!). 
# It tells the OS what program to use to run the subsequent script.
# For this assignment, we are using bash; however, you could also point to other interpreters such as zsh or even python (don't do this).
# It may be the case that you want to use a bash program that is in a different location (e.g., a newer version than one shipped with your OS).
# For this, you just need to change the path after the shebang.

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
